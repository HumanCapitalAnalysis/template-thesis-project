# Teá¸¿plate for thesis projects

This is a template for thesis projects.

If you are writing your thesis with our group, please sign up for a [GitHub Account](http://github.com) and join us on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/humancapitalanalysis/shared_invite/enQtNDQ0ODkyODYyODA2LWEyZjdlNWYwYmUyNzlkOWFkNWJkMGI5M2M4ZWUyMThhNWNiMmJhY2ZjY2E4YzE3NGQ5MzcxZTRhN2QxYjgxYWY).

## Python

All thesis projects involve extensive [Python](https://www.python.org) programming. Please see the [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/) for a gentle introduction to the science stack. [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) and  [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) offer convenient development environments for your project.

## Reproducibility

To ensure full reproducibility of your project, please set up a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) as your continuous integration service. This includes the compilation of the final PDF as well as the codes that create the material used there.
